    <div class="content has-text-justified">
      This project presents a decentralized safe path-following framework for multiple quadrotors moving on intersecting paths. The controller combines path-following objectives with safety-critical constraints on attitude and inter-agent collision avoidance. A quadratic program is solved for each agent at every time step to enforce safe behavior while tracking the desired path.

- path-following constraints,
- roll and pitch safety constraints,
- pairwise collision avoidance constraints,
- a per-agent quadratic program solved online.
